# EvolutionSimulator
This is literally a biology project yes I am doing this for a biology class ~~please send help please please please~~

This simulation is inspired by [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh), who has made several simulations in this style.

The simulation is done using Processing 3, also inspired by Cary. Unfortunately that means it's Java. I tried to make it decent, I promise.
